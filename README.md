# Lending Club Loan Analysis and Modeling
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club))

The goal of this project is to analyze and model Lending Club's issued loans.


## Data
The loan data is available through multiple sources, including [Kaggle Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data), [All Lending Club Load Data](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), or [Lending Club Statistics](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). In this project, I use the data from [Kaggle Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data), which contains the issued load data from 2007 to 2015. In addition, I also use the issued loan data from 2016 from [Lending Club Statistics](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action).
